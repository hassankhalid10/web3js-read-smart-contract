Deployment of Smart Contract using web3js::

This script reads a Solidity smart contract from a file, compiles it using the Solidity compiler, and deploys it to a local Ethereum network (like Ganache). It performs the following steps:

1. **Read the Contract File:** Reads the Solidity file (`demo.sol`) containing the smart contract code.
2. **Compile the Contract:** Uses the Solidity compiler (`solc`) to compile the contract code into bytecode and ABI.
3. **Extract ABI and Bytecode:** Retrieves the ABI and bytecode from the compiled output.
4. **Deploy the Contract:** Deploys the compiled contract to the local Ethereum network using Web3, and logs the contract address and deployment status.

**Commands to Run:**
1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install solc fs web3
   ```

2. **Run the Script:**
   ```bash
   node your-script-file.js
   ``` 

Replace `your-script-file.js` with the filename where the script is saved.
